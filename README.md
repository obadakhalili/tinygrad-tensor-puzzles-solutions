# tinygrad Tensor Puzzles

- This project adapts [Sasha's Tensor Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Tensor-Puzzles) to tinygrad

- I complay with the specified rules:

  ```
  - Each puzzle needs to be solved in 1 line (<80 columns) of code

  - You are allowed @, arithmetic, comparison, `shape`, any indexing (e.g. `a[:j], a[:, None], a[arange(10)]`), and previous puzzle functions

  - You are not allowed anything else. No `view`, `sum`, `take`, `squeeze`, `tensor`

  - You can start with `arange` & `where`
  ```
